NYSFL Half Quals Chart

Here is the chart of the number of participants it takes to qualify speakers to the NYSFL Championship.

At a regular tournament
There must be at least 2 schools and 3 speakers in a category in order to have a half qual available.

| Speakers | Half Quals |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 3-5      | 1          |
| 6-10     | 2          |
| 11-15    | 3          |
| 16-20    | 4          |
| 21-25    | 5          |
| 26-30    | 6          |

After 30, the ratio changes to one half qual for every 10 speakers.
