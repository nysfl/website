Welcome to the official website of the New York State Forensic League (NYSFL). Our mission is to “develop articulate adults who revere truth and who effectively 
express the truth as they participate in the life of the nation”.  In order to promote this mission, the NYSFL aims to stimulate speech activities in the high 
schools of New York State by encouraging schools and their students to participate in the forensic activities we offer.

The NYSFL sponsors annually the New York State Grand Championship Tournament, for which students of member schools may qualify individually. Membership is open 
to all high schools (grades 9-12) in New York State – public, private and religious. Qualification for the Grand Championship Tournament is according to the 
rules set out in the NYSFL By-Laws and Tournament Handbook.

If your school is interested in beginning a program of speech and debate activities and would like to join the NYSFL, please click on “Contact Us” and we will be 
very happy to welcome and assist you.
